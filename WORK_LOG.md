| Oct 13 |   8:15-9pm    |                                                                           I found a solution to the code but I did it in a very crude manner. I did what I believe to be is what I did for CS1. I brut-forced the solution whole iterative loops. I had some trouble at first on how to count the longest STR repetition instead of just the number of STRs in the total sequence. This was easily fixed though by resetting count after every break in the pattern and then just comparing count with longest count until the end. This is a very rough draft solution that works. Next, I will try to find a more efficient way to solve the solution. |
| Oct 15 | 11:15-11:55am | I brainstormed an optimization for my code but I'm not sure exactly how I would implement it. My code is current the efficiency of O(seqeunce length * STR Length). We know that the sequence length has to be included because we are not able to skip any values in the sequence and get the correct answer. So the solution lies in how to decrease the time in comparing each letter in the STR to letters in the sequence. Right now, we had an idea of just setting numerical values/weightings that would be compared int constant time, however, we know this probably won't be more effcient because of the time it takes to assign the values. |
