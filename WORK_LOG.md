I did what I believe to be is what I did for CS1. I brut-forced the solution whole iterative loops. I had some trouble at first on how to count the longest STR repetition instead of just the number of STRs in the total sequence. This was easily fixed though by resetting count after every break in the pattern and then just comparing count with longest count until the end. This is a very rough draft solution that works. Next, I will try to find a more efficient way to solve the solution. |

My code is current the efficiency of O(seqeunce length * STR Length). We know that the sequence length has to be included because we are not able to skip any values in the sequence and get the correct answer. So the solution lies in how to decrease the time in comparing each letter in the STR to letters in the sequence. Right now, we had an idea of just setting numerical values/weightings that would be compared int constant time, however, we know this probably won't be more effcient because of the time it takes to assign the values. |
| Oct 19 |  3:00-4:30pm  | After the class on DNA 2.0 Theory, I started to work on the new algorithm. At first, everything seemed really easy and I finished the code in a reasonable amount of time. However, my code did not work and still does not work. I first, I had an error with overflow in my has function. I had to fix that with some casting and making my p value smaller (I'm not sure if it is supposed to be an int or a long). Then, when my code ran, I ran into issues of getting incorrect values. I tried using the debugger to see where my code was not counting, and I came to the conclusion that there is something wrong with my hash function. My brain is pretty burnt out so I left off here and the ask Mr. Blick in class for help. |
