| Oct 13 |   8:15-9pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I found a solution to the code but I did it in a very crude manner. I did what I believe to be is what I did for CS1. I brut-forced the solution whole iterative loops. I had some trouble at first on how to count the longest STR repetition instead of just the number of STRs in the total sequence. This was easily fixed though by resetting count after every break in the pattern and then just comparing count with longest count until the end. This is a very rough draft solution that works. Next, I will try to find a more efficient way to solve the solution. |

My code is current the efficiency of O(seqeunce length * STR Length). We know that the sequence length has to be included because we are not able to skip any values in the sequence and get the correct answer. So the solution lies in how to decrease the time in comparing each letter in the STR to letters in the sequence. Right now, we had an idea of just setting numerical values/weightings that would be compared int constant time, however, we know this probably won't be more efficient because of the time it takes to assign the values. |
| Oct 19 |  3:00-4:30pm  |                                                     After the class on DNA 2.0 Theory, I started to work on the new algorithm. At first, everything seemed really easy and I finished the code in a reasonable amount of time. However, my code did not work and still does not work. I first, I had an error with overflow in my has function. I had to fix that with some casting and making my p value smaller (I'm not sure if it is supposed to be an int or a long). Then, when my code ran, I ran into issues of getting incorrect values. I tried using the debugger to see where my code was not counting, and I came to the conclusion that there is something wrong with my hash function. My brain is pretty burnt out so I left off here and the ask Mr. Blick in class for help. |

I wanted to narrow down a question for him so I asked him how to get a good P value. We went online and found some random prime number generators until we found one with desirable qualities. This helped narrow down why my code was producing incorrect outputs. The rest of tutorial I tried fixing my hash function. I made the mistake of using recursion and not using horner's method. Mr. Blick help me implement it but it still did not work. |

It was a simple fix, with horner's method. My calculation line in the for loop was a little wrong, but with minor change in casting and variable types, I was able to fix it. My code worked for every test except largest (I had not pulled tricky yet). |
| Oct 22 |   1-1:45pm    | I knew that the hash function alone would not yield a better runtime that linear search, so I knew I had to implement the "sliding" mechanic for every time a match was not found. I ignored the couple of test cases that did not work to make sure I could get the sliding function down for the more basic tests. I had a lot of trouble because at first, I assumed everything was correct because I followed the same logic as the slides, but I realized my indexes were a little off. After some debugging with Mr. Blick, we realized we were not using the correct indexes and after we fixed that the code worked for every test except tricky. I fixed test largest pretty easily because I realized it was just the edge case when the longest sequence included the last indexes. |
| Oct 26 |  10:30-11:20  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was a bit confused why tricky did not work, but before I left my last class, I discovered it was because of the edge cause when the longest sequence of STRs overlaps with another. So, a solution that I thought of was to capture when the code comes off of a sequences of matching, set sequence hash to the second index of the last match. At first, this did not work because I was setting the sequence has to the index, but not the index of the loop. When I realized this I quickly changed it and it began to work. |
